# Test Case Writing Guidelines

## Clarity
- Use imperative language: "Click", "Enter", "Verify"
- Include specific UI elements (button names, field labels)
- One action per step
- Avoid ambiguous terms ("appropriate", "several")

## Completeness
- Provide realistic test data for every input
- Specify expected results for each step
- Cover all acceptance criteria
- Include pre-conditions and post-conditions

## Measurability
- Expected results must be verifiable
- Use specific values, not ranges (unless testing ranges)
- Document what should AND should NOT happen

## Traceability
- Link to user story ID
- Map to acceptance criteria
- Reference related user stories
- Note dependencies
